# AAP 2.5 Notes:
# - This configuration is primarily for local development and testing
# - AAP 2.5 execution environments override many of these settings
# - Key settings that remain relevant in AAP:
#   * stdout_callback for output formatting
#   * interpreter_python for Python path resolution
#   * deprecation_warnings for maintenance planning
#   * Security settings for compliance
